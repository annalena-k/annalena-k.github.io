Hi! My name is Annalena (she/her) and I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen](https://is.mpg.de) supervised by [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). I am part of the [IMPRS-IS graduate program](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/scholars) and the interdisciplinary [ELLIS PhD program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).
Previously, I completed my physics Bachelor's and Master's degree at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). For my Master's thesis, I was fortunate to be supervised by [Lukas Heinrich](https://www.lukasheinrich.com), [Michael Kagan](https://sparks.cern/kagan-michael), and [Vincent Stimper](https://vincentstimper.com).

# Research Interests
* Deep Generative Modelling and Simulation-Based Inference
* Automatic Differentiation and Differentiable (Physics) Simulators
* Physics: Gravitational Waves, Particle Physics, Characterization of Exoplanets

If you are interested in my work and have questions or ideas, please reach out via email. I'm always motivated to chat!

➡️ _You are looking for a Master's thesis topic at the intersection of ML and physics? Perfect, drop me an email explaining your background, qualifications, and interests. I will try to get back to you quickly._

# Diversity
I actively work towards a welcoming and encouraging environment for people from marginalized groups in physics, ML, and academia in general. In order to be transparent about my learning and contributing journey, I will keep track of the most recent events I attended and/or organized:
* (Since August 2024) Mentoring of PhD applicants from underrepresented communities (2024/25: 3 people)
* (Since January 2024) Organizer of [Athena group](https://is.mpg.de/athena-group) meetings and PhD student representative at Gender Equality Committee of MPI-IS Tübingen
* (June 2025) Organized Unconscious Bias Training at MPI-IS Tübingen & Stuttgart
* (January 2025) Organized [#IAMRemarkable Workshop](https://www.rmrkblty.org/iamremarkable) at MPI-IS Tübingen & Stuttgart
* (December 2024) Attended [19th WiML workshop](https://sites.google.com/wimlworkshop.org/wiml-2024/home) at NeurIPS and talks of diversity seminar series at Tübingen MPI campus
* (November 2023 - June 2024) Supported students that are disadvantaged in the German education system with their scholarship application through [ApplicAid](https://www.applicaid.org)

Since students from marginalized groups face specific challenges and lack support, I decided to exclusively offer mentoring for people from these groups. If you are interested, please contact me via email and explain why you reach out to me, specifically.
