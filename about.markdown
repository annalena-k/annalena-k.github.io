Hi! My name is Annalena and I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen](https://is.mpg.de) supervised by [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). I am part of the [IMPRS-IS graduate program](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/scholars) and the interdisciplinary [ELLIS PhD program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).
Previously, I completed my physics Bachelor's and Master's degree at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). For my Master's thesis, I was fortunate to be supervised by [Lukas Heinrich](https://www.lukasheinrich.com), [Michael Kagan](https://sparks.cern/kagan-michael), and [Vincent Stimper](https://is.mpg.de/~vstimper).

During my studies, I received a full scholarship by the [Heinrich Böll Foundation](https://www.boell.de/de/stipendien) and the [Max Weber-Program](https://www.boell.de/de/stipendien). During my Bachelor, I was selected for the [RISE-DAAD](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/) scholarship that allowed me to do an internship at the University of San Jose under the supervision of [Mariela Porras-Chaverri](https://fimec.webnode.es/researchers/).

# Research Interests
* Deep Generative Modelling for Physics
* Simulation-Based Inference and Differentiable Simulations
* Posterior Estimation for Gravitational Waves
* Efficient Event Generation in Particle Physics

I am always intersted in discussing ideas and potential collaborations that align with my research focus. Please reach out via email if you would like to have a chat!

# Talks and Conferences
* (June 2023) Presented poster at [Nordic Probabilistic AI School](https://probabilistic.ai) supported by a full scholarship of DeepMind
* (March 2023) Presented Master's thesis at the annual meeting of the [German Physical Society](https://www.dpg-physik.de) supported by the scholarship of the [Wilhelm and Else Heraeus Foundation](https://www.we-heraeus-stiftung.de/english/)

# Community Service
* (Since January 2024) Organizer of [Athena group](https://is.mpg.de/athena-group) meetings at MPI-IS Tübingen
* (Since November 2023) Serving as mentor for [ApplicAid](https://www.applicaid.org)
* (March 2023 - October 2023) Organized seminar with external speakers for the [Origins Data Science Lab](https://www.origins-cluster.de/en/infrastructure/odsl)
* (October 2021 - October 2023) Elected as scholarship representative and committee member for the selection of new scholars of the Heinrich Böll Foundation

# Diversity
I actively work towards a welcoming and encouraging environment for people from marginalized groups in physics, ML, and academia in general. In order to be transparent about my learning and contributing journey, I will keep track of the most recent events I attended and/or organized:
* (Since November 2023) Supporting students that are disadvantaged in the German education system with their scholarship application through [ApplicAid](https://www.applicaid.org)
* (March 2024) Participated in "Unconscious Bias Training" offered by the Max Planck Society
* (June 2023) Organized and conducted training on "How to deal with sexist comments" (repetition), served on "Women's advisory board" for workshop ["Advocates and Allies: Male Allies for Gender Equality"](https://www.zv.tum.de/en/diversity/news-events/news-singleview-en/article/workshop-advocates-and-allies-male-allies-for-gender-equality/)
* (February 2023) Participated in seminar "Diversity as a reference frame for good leadership" by the [Institute for Social Justice and Radical Diversity](https://institut-social-justice.org) 
* (November 2022) Organized and conducted training on "How to deal with sexist comments"
* (October 2022) Organized ["Day of minorities in physics"](https://www.ph.tum.de/about/diversity/gender/events/1/) and "Sharing experiences with sexism"
* (March 2022) Attended seminar about classism
* (October 2021 - 2022) Served as student representative of equality council at the TUM physics department and organized regular informal meetings for gender minorities in physics
* (October 2021) Organized networking event for female physics students at TUM

Since students from marginalized groups face specific challenges and lack support, I decided to exclusively offer mentoring for people from these groups. If you are interested, please contact me via email and explain why you reach out to me, specifically.
