Hi! My name is Annalena and I am an incoming PhD student in Machine Learning at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen](https://is.mpg.de) supervised by [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). I will be part of the [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/scholars) graduate program and the interdisciplinary [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD program. I will be part of the [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/scholars) graduate program and the interdisciplinary [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD program.
Previously, I completed my physics Bachelor's and Master's degree at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). For my Master's thesis, I was fortunate to be supervised by [Lukas Heinrich](https://www.lukasheinrich.com), [Michael Kagan](https://sparks.cern/kagan-michael), and [Vincent Stimper](https://is.mpg.de/~vstimper).

During my studies, I received a full scholarship by the [Heinrich Böll Foundation](https://www.boell.de/de/stipendien) and the [Max Weber-Program](https://www.boell.de/de/stipendien). During my Bachelor, I was selected for the [RISE-DAAD](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/) scholarship where I worked at [FIMEC](https://fimec.webnode.es/researchers/).

# Talks and Conferences
* (June 2023) presented poster at [Nordic Probabilistic AI School](https://probabilistic.ai) supported by a full scholarship of DeepMind
* (March 2023) presented Master's thesis at the annual meeting of the [German Physical Society](https://www.dpg-physik.de) supported by the scholarship of the [Wilhelm and Else Heraeus Foundation](https://www.we-heraeus-stiftung.de/english/)

# Community Service
* (March 2023 - October 2023) organized seminar with external speakers for the [Origins Data Science Lab](https://www.origins-cluster.de/en/infrastructure/odsl)
* (October 2021 - October 2023) elected as scholarship representative and committee member for the selection of new scholars of the Heinrich Böll Foundation

# Diversity
I actively work towards a welcoming and encouraging environment for people from marginalized groups in physics, ML, and academia in general. In order to be transparent about my learning and contributing journey, I will keep track of the most recent events I attended and/or organized:
* (June 2023) organized and conducted training on "How to deal with sexist comments" (repetition), served on "Women's advisory board" for workshop ["Advocates and Allies: Male Allies for Gender Equality"](https://www.zv.tum.de/en/diversity/news-events/news-singleview-en/article/workshop-advocates-and-allies-male-allies-for-gender-equality/)
* (February 2023) participated in seminar "Diversity as a reference frame for good leadership" by the [Institute for Social Justice and Radical Diversity](https://institut-social-justice.org) 
* (November 2022) organized and conducted training on "How to deal with sexist comments"
* (October 2022) organized ["Day of minorities in physics"](https://www.ph.tum.de/about/diversity/gender/events/1/) and "Sharing experiences with sexism"
* (March 2022) attended seminar about classism
* (October 2021 - 2022) served as student representative of equality council at the TUM physics department and organized regular informal meetings for gender minorities in physics
* (October 2021) organized networking event for female physics students at TUM
Since students from marginalized groups face specific challenges and lack support, I decided to exclusively offer mentoring for people from these groups. If you are interested, please contact me via email and explain why you reach out to me, specifically.
