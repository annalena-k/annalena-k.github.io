I am an incoming PhD student in Machine Learning at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen](https://is.mpg.de) supervised by [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). I will be part of the [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/scholars) graduate program and the interdisciplinary [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD program.

My research interests lie at the fascinating intersection of ML and physics. During my PhD, I will be working on deep generative modelling and simulation-based inference for gravitational wave parameters.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/annalena-k), [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/annalena-kofler-0baa39190), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AnnalenaKofler).

# News
* (October 2023) Moving from Munich to Tübingen. I am excited to start at the MPI-IS soon.
* (September 2023) Sucessfully defended my Master's Thesis on "Efficient Sampling from Differentiable Matrix Elements"!
