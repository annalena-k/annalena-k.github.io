I am an incoming PhD student in Machine Learning at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen supervised by Bernhard Schölkopf. I will be part of the [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/scholars) graduate program and the interdisciplinary [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) PhD program.
Previously, I completed my physics Bachelor's and Master's degree at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). For my Master's thesis, I was fortunate to be supervised by [Lukas Heinrich](https://www.lukasheinrich.com), [Michael Kagan](https://sparks.cern/kagan-michael), and [Vincent Stimper](https://is.mpg.de/~vstimper).

My research interests lie at the fascinating intersection of ML and physics, mainly deep generative modelling. During my PhD, I will be working on simulation-based inference for gravitational wave parameters.
