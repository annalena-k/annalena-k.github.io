I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen](https://is.mpg.de) supervised by [Bernhard Schölkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs). I am part of the [IMPRS-IS graduate program](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/scholars) and the interdisciplinary track of the [ELLIS PhD program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).

My research interests lie at the fascinating intersection of Machine Learning  and physics. During my PhD, I am working on simulation-based inference and neural posterior estimation for gravitational wave signals. I am a developer of the [DINGO](https://dingo-gw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) package.

# News
* (June 2024) Interested in a [DINGO tutorial](https://dingo-gw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)? We will hold a public event on June 19th. Please reach out for details.
* (May 2024) See you at the [PHYSTAT Workshop on "Simulation Based Inference for Fundamental Physics](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355601/) in Munich! You can find me at the poster session with my best [poster design](https://github.com/annalena-k/presentations-posters-and-other-fun-things/blob/main/2024/20240516_Poster_SBI_Workshop_Munich.pdf) so far!
* (April 2024) Attended the [AIslands Workshop](https://www.gla.ac.uk/events/conferences/aislands-arran24/) on ML for gravitational wave astronomy and gave an [overview presentation](https://github.com/annalena-k/presentations-posters-and-other-fun-things/blob/main/2024/20240424_Presentation_AIslands.pdf) about DINGO.
* (November 2023) Started my PhD at the Empirical Inference Department! I am looking forward to getting to know all my amazing colleagues.
